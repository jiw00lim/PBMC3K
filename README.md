# PBMC3K scRNA-seq Analysis with Scanpy
This repository contains my practice analyses of the **3k Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMC3K)** dataset using [Scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/).  
As a wet-lab scientist working on developing treatments for cancer patients, I became fascinated by how **single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq)** can reveal cellular heterogeneity and help identify therapeutic targets _in silico_.  
This project documents my hands-on learning process with Scanpy and demonstrates my growing computational biology skill set.
